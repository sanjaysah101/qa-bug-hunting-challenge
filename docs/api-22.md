# API-22: User Creation Server Error Bug Report

## Bug Description

When creating a new user through the `/users` endpoint with task ID `api-22`, the development environment incorrectly returns a 500 server error, while the same request works correctly in the production environment.

## Environment Details

- **Development URL**: <https://dev-gs.qa-playground.com/api/v1>
- **Production URL**: <https://release-gs.qa-playground.com/api/v1>
- **Task ID**: api-22
- **Endpoint**: POST /users
- **HTTP Method**: POST

## Authentication Requirements

All requests require:

- Bearer Token: `Bearer qahack2024:sanjay1@example.com`
- Task ID Header: `X-Task-Id: api-22`

## Steps to Reproduce

```json
{
  "email": "sanjay87520@gmail.com",
  "password": "password123",
  "name": "sanjay",
  "nickname": "sanjay"
}
```

## Expected vs Actual Behavior

### Expected Response (Production)

```json
{
  "email": "sanjay87520@gmail.com",
  "name": "sanjay",
  "nickname": "sanjay",
  "avatar_url": "",
  "uuid": "<dynamic-uuid>"
}
```

### Actual Response (Development)

```json
{
  "code": 500,
  "message": "Internal Server Error"
}
```

## Test Implementation

The bug is verified using the following test case:

```typescript
it("should create a new user", async () => {
  const { createUser } = await createTestContext();
  const response = await createUser(VALID_USER);
  expect(response.status).toBe(200);
  expect(response.data).toMatchObject({
    email: VALID_USER.email,
    name: VALID_USER.name,
    nickname: VALID_USER.nickname,
    avatar_url: "",
    uuid: expect.any(String),
  });
});
```

## Verification Results

- ‚úÖ Test passes in Production environment
- ‚ùå Test fails in Development environment
- üîÑ Issue is consistently reproducible

## Test Evidence

```diff
Expected  - 1
Received  + 1

- status: 200
+ status: 500

- {
-   "email": "sanjay87520@gmail.com",
-   "name": "sanjay",
-   "nickname": "sanjay",
-   "avatar_url": "",
-   "uuid": "<dynamic-uuid>"
- }
+ {
+   "code": 500,
+   "message": "Internal Server Error"
+ }
```

## Additional Notes

- The bug only occurs in the development environment
- The API returns a 500 status code instead of the expected 200
- This issue is specific to task ID `api-22`
- The bug demonstrates a clear difference between development and production environments
- All request validation tests pass in both environments

- Environment Config: `src/config/environment.ts`

## Running the Test

```bash
# Run in development environment to see the bug
pnpm test:dev

# Run in production environment to verify correct behavior
pnpm test:prod
```

## Bug Impact

This bug prevents user creation in the development environment, which could:

- Block development and testing of features that depend on user creation
- Cause integration tests to fail in development pipelines
- Impact local development and testing workflows

## Possible Investigation Points

1. Server-side error handling in development environment
2. Database connection issues specific to development
3. Environment-specific configuration differences
4. Middleware or validation logic that might be failing silently
